~~Frontend Build Errors~~
~~1. Missing web-vitals package:~~
   ~~- Error: `Can't resolve 'web-vitals' in '/home/grace/Desktop/Marketingneo/frontend/src'`~~
   ~~- Solution: Need to install web-vitals package~~
   ~~- Prevention: This is a default dependency for Create React App performance monitoring~~

~~2. Tailwind CSS Configuration Issue:~~
   ~~- Error: `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin is not supported~~
   ~~- Root Cause: Need to follow exact Create React App with Tailwind CSS setup~~
   ~~- Required Steps:~~
     ~~1. Remove all current Tailwind-related packages~~
     ~~2. Start fresh with official Create React App + Tailwind CSS setup~~
     ~~3. Configure tailwind.config.js~~
     ~~4. Add Tailwind directives to index.css~~
   ~~- Prevention: Follow official documentation for specific framework integrations~~

## Next Steps

### Backend Development
1. ⏳ Install nodemon for development
2. ⏳ Test local server functionality
3. ⏳ Set up OpenAI API key in backend/.env

### Frontend Development
1. ⏳ Update MarketingneoChatbot to use environment variable for API endpoint
2. ⏳ Test frontend-backend integration locally

### AWS Deployment
1. ⏳ Set up AWS credentials
2. ⏳ Create Lambda function
3. ⏳ Set up API Gateway
4. ⏳ Deploy backend
5. ⏳ Update frontend with production API endpoint
6. ⏳ Deploy frontend to S3/CloudFront

## Current Environment Variables Needed

### Backend (.env)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Frontend (.env)
```
REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3001/chat  # For local development
# Will be updated to API Gateway URL for production
```

## Questions to Address
1. Do you have an OpenAI API key to proceed with testing?
2. Do you have AWS credentials set up for deployment?
3. Would you like to test the local development setup first before proceeding with AWS deployment?

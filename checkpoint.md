~~Frontend Build Errors~~
~~1. Missing web-vitals package:~~
   ~~- Error: `Can't resolve 'web-vitals' in '/home/grace/Desktop/Marketingneo/frontend/src'`~~
   ~~- Solution: Need to install web-vitals package~~
   ~~- Prevention: This is a default dependency for Create React App performance monitoring~~

~~2. Tailwind CSS Configuration Issue:~~
   ~~- Error: `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin is not supported~~
   ~~- Root Cause: Need to follow exact Create React App with Tailwind CSS setup~~
   ~~- Required Steps:~~
     ~~1. Remove all current Tailwind-related packages~~
     ~~2. Start fresh with official Create React App + Tailwind CSS setup~~
     ~~3. Configure tailwind.config.js~~
     ~~4. Add Tailwind directives to index.css~~
   ~~- Prevention: Follow official documentation for specific framework integrations~~

## Next Steps

### Backend Development
1. ⏳ Install nodemon for development
2. ⏳ Test local server functionality
3. ⏳ Set up OpenAI API key in backend/.env

### Frontend Development
1. ⏳ Update MarketingneoChatbot to use environment variable for API endpoint
2. ⏳ Test frontend-backend integration locally

### AWS Deployment
1. ✅ Set up AWS credentials
2. ✅ Create Lambda function
   - Function name: marketingneo-api
   - Runtime: nodejs18.x
   - Environment variables configured (ASSISTANT_ID, OPENAI_API_KEY, ORGANIZATION_ID)
3. ✅ Set up API Gateway
   - API ID: 8goja6cczf
   - Stage: prod
   - Resource: /chat with POST method
4. ✅ Deploy backend
5. ✅ Update frontend with production API endpoint
   - Updated REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT to use API Gateway URL
6. ✅ Added backend/.lambdaignore for deployment optimization
   - Purpose: Reduce Lambda deployment package size by excluding non-essential files
   - Excluded files/directories:
     * Test files (*.test.js, *.spec.js, test/, tests/, __tests__/)
     * Development files (local-server.js, package-lock.json)
     * Source maps (*.map)
     * Documentation (README.md)
     * Git-related files (.git/, .gitignore)
     * node_modules/ (will be reinstalled during deployment)
   - Benefits:
     * Faster deployments due to smaller package size
     * Lower risk of including sensitive files
     * Better organization of deployment artifacts
     * Improved deployment reliability

7. ✅ Updated Lambda function code
   - Executed: aws lambda update-function-code --function-name marketingneo-api --zip-file fileb://function.zip
   - New deployment package respects .lambdaignore rules
   - Successfully updated function code (CodeSize: 6090362 bytes)

8. ⏳ Deploy frontend to S3/CloudFront

### Resolved Issues and Implementations

#### 1. CORS Configuration (✅ Resolved)
We successfully resolved CORS issues through a comprehensive approach:

1. API Gateway Configuration:
   - Implemented OPTIONS method for preflight requests
   - Configured proper CORS headers in method response
   - Set up mock integration for OPTIONS method
   - Added integration response with correct CORS headers:
     ```
     Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token
     Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST,OPTIONS
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
     ```

2. Lambda Function Configuration:
   - Modified Lambda response to include CORS headers
   - Implemented proper error handling with CORS headers
   - Ensured headers are present in both success and error responses
   ```javascript
   const response = {
     statusCode: 200,
     headers: {
       'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
       'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST, OPTIONS',
       'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token'
     },
     body: JSON.stringify({ response: result })
   };
   ```

3. Testing and Verification:
   - ✅ Browser preflight requests succeed
   - ✅ POST requests work from frontend application
   - ✅ CORS headers present in all responses
   - ✅ No more "Missing Authentication Token" errors

#### 2. Lambda Configuration (✅ Resolved)
Successfully configured Lambda function with:

1. Function Setup:
   - Runtime: nodejs18.x
   - Handler: index.handler
   - Memory: 256 MB
   - Timeout: 30 seconds

2. Environment Variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=[configured]
   ASSISTANT_ID=asst_PLQBp59e7qFbVE1rxxFUeKHo
   ORGANIZATION_ID=org-IZme85Zl1mFSthuyalHQUL8q
   ```

3. IAM Role Configuration:
   - Basic Lambda execution role
   - CloudWatch Logs permissions
   - API Gateway invoke permissions

4. Deployment Package Optimization:
   - Implemented .lambdaignore for smaller package size
   - Excluded development dependencies
   - Included only production dependencies

#### 3. S3 Frontend Deployment (✅ Resolved)
Successfully deployed frontend to S3 with the following steps:

1. Bucket Creation and Configuration:
   ```bash

     --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-2
   ```

2. Static Website Hosting:
   ```bash
   aws s3 website s3://marketingneo-frontend \
     --index-document index.html \
     --error-document index.html
   ```

3. Public Access Configuration:
   - Disabled block public access settings
   - Added bucket policy for public read access:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [{
       "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": "*",
       "Action": "s3:GetObject",
       "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::marketingneo-frontend/*"
     }]
   }
   ```

4. Deployment Process:
   - Built production React app: `npm run build`
   - Synced files to S3: `aws s3 sync build/ s3://marketingneo-frontend --delete`
   - Verified deployment at: http://marketingneo-frontend.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
